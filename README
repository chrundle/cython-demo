This is a small example of one way to call a C function from
within Python using Cython. This particular example involves
a C function for which the input a pointer to a user defined 
C struct.

To build the necessary files to call the function within
Python, type the following in the command line:

        python setup.py build_ext -i

Following this, the "pytest" module can be imported when
using Python. As an example, we can then call our Python
function "test" (which calls the C function test) by 
starting Python and tying the following commands:

    >>> from pytest import test
    >>> test()

The output should be:

    Calling pretest
    Double is 1.5
    Int is 0
    Exiting test and returning n
    0

This example was constructed mainly to develop an 
understanding of how to call C functions from within Python.
